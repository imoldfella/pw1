### Changed

- Created separate changelog files for each project (except unit tests).


## [3.0.2] - 2022-12-07

### Changed

- Rewrote `nuget-push.yml` to use `dotnet` commands directly instead of `rohith/publish-nuget`
- Updated doc site dependencies to resolve security warnings
- Wrote separate README files for each package


## [3.0.1] - 2022-12-03

### Changed

- Split unit tests into three new projects:
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Screenplay.UnitTests`
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Playwright.UnitTests`
  - `Boa.Constrictor.RestSharp.UnitTests`
- Updated unit test dependency package versions
- Updated GitHub Action to run all unit tests in the new projects

### Fixed

- Updated Boa Constrictor package dependencies to NOT refer to an alpha release


## [3.0.0] - 2022-12-02

### Added

- Split the `Boa.Constrictor` project into three new projects:
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Screenplay` for the "core" pattern
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Playwright` for Selenium WebDriver interactions
  - `Boa.Constrictor.RestSharp` for RestSharp interactions
- Published new NuGet packages for the three new projects
  - That way, you can choose which interaction libraries to use
  - The original `Boa.Constrictor` package will be empty but hold dependencies to these three for backwards compatibility
  - Updated GitHub Actions for publishing them
- Set dependencies based on configuration
  - Local development (Configuration=Debug) will use project references
  - NuGet packages (Configuration=Release) will use NuGet packages
  - The `Example` and `UnitTests` projects always use project references

### Changed

- Renamed the following namespaces:
  - `Boa.Constrictor.WebDriver` -> `Boa.Constrictor.Playwright`
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Dumping` -> `Boa.Constrictor.Screenplay`
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Logging` -> `Boa.Constrictor.Screenplay`
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Safety` -> `Boa.Constrictor.Screenplay`
  - `Boa.Constrictor.Utilities` -> `Boa.Constrictor.Screenplay`
  - *Warning:* this is a backwards-incompatible change, but a straightforward one to handle
